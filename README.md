# Notes App

## Description
Capture your ideas instantly with this sleek, lightweight notes application. Built with a **backend** and **frontend**, it’s designed for speed, simplicity, and productivity.


- **Quick Capture:** Press **F9** anywhere to open the input window and jot down a new thought.  
- **Structured Notes:** Easily add a **category** and **description** to organize your ideas.  
- **Local Storage:** All notes are saved to a local database file for fast access and persistence.  
- **Minimal Distraction:** The app runs quietly in the background, letting you focus on what matters while still keeping your ideas at your fingertips.

Perfect for developers, creatives, or anyone who wants to catch ideas before they slip away.


## Motivation

I wanted a tool that wouldn't interrupt my workflow. There was always this thought: *"this should be doable."* My goal is to integrate seamlessly, allowing you to capture ideas **while continuing what you’re already doing**, without breaking your focus.
